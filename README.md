Carpark Vacancy Detection using Computer Vision

This project focuses on leveraging computer vision techniques to streamline the process of finding vacant parking spots within a carpark. The aim is to provide a user-friendly solution that not only indicates the availability of parking spaces but also offers real-time information about the number of vacant spots.

Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and efficient system that can detect and visualize vacant parking spaces in a carpark. The following components constitute the core of the solution:

Computer Vision Algorithms: Advanced computer vision algorithms are employed to analyze images or video feed from the carpark. These algorithms identify vacant parking spots and mark them visually.
Real-time Updates: The system offers real-time updates regarding the availability of parking spaces. As vehicles enter or leave the carpark, the algorithm dynamically adjusts the status of each parking spot.
Visual Indicators: Vacant parking spots are highlighted with visual indicators, making it easy for drivers to identify available spaces quickly.
Vacancy Count: The system also provides an accurate count of available parking spaces, which can be displayed on digital signage at carpark entrances or accessed through a dedicated application.
How it Works

Data Collection: Cameras or other image capture devices are strategically positioned to capture the carpark area.
Image Processing: Computer vision techniques process the captured images or video frames to identify unoccupied parking spots.
Visual Indicators: The identified vacant parking spots are highlighted with visual markers such as color-coded boxes.
Vacancy Count: The system calculates the total number of vacant spaces based on the identified spots and displays this count.
Getting Started

To set up and deploy the Carpark Vacancy Detection system:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the provided requirements.txt file.
Configure camera or image sources to capture carpark footage.
Run the main detection script to start monitoring and indicating vacant parking spots.
Conclusion

The Carpark Vacancy Detection project offers an innovative solution to address the challenge of finding available parking spaces efficiently. By harnessing the power of computer vision, this system enhances the user experience, reduces parking search time, and contributes to more effective utilization of parking facilities.
